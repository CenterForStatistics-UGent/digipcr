# digipcr
treshold methods in R for digital PCR

## Purpose

This repository serves the development of one or more R packages for the analysis of digital PCR data. The package will
implement multiple methods for determining a treshold for classification and the calculation of the concentration based
on this. In that respect it will be different from the current packages on dPCR that mostly implement a single method and/or
only part of the analysis chain. 

## Installing the package.

Eventually the package will be pushed to CRAN and a BioConductor interface will be made available as well. Until then,
the package can be installed from github using

```
devtools::install_github("CenterForStatistics-UGent/digipcr")
```
